# When changing these, don't forget to update progress bonuses in events and JEs
##EXETHER: we lowered all of these 10% from vanilla, except era 5 which was lowered around 8%.  We did not change any bonuses from generic events.
era_1 = { #Pre-1836
	technology_cost = 6750 # for progress bonuses, use an approximate third: 2250
}

era_2 = { #1836-1861
	technology_cost = 9000 # for progress bonuses, use an approximate third: 3000
}

era_3 = { #1862-1886
	technology_cost = 11250 # for progress bonuses, use an approximate third: 3750
}

era_4 = { #1887-1911
	technology_cost = 13500 # for progress bonuses, use an approximate third: 4500
}

era_5 = { #1911-1936
	technology_cost = 16000 # for progress bonuses, use an approximate third: 5500 #less of a proportional reduction than the others
}
