  DUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Empire of Dumonia is a land of ancient traditions and fading glory, once the center of human power before the rise of magic brought it crashing down. The Nightfall led to the collapse of most of the empire, and today only the heartlands on Noricum remain under imperial control. It must grapple with a host of internal problems lest it be reduced to an even more humiliating state. Internal divides and external enemies, the Empire will have to tackle and resolve those issues before it can even consider looking West to restore its former glory."
  MAN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "[Country.GetFlavorText]"
  ABR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Albiar is a large Imperial province of the currently withering Dumonian Empire. Its loyalty is tenuous at best as only through proximity to the heartlands has Albriar been kept under the thumb of Crownpeak. Though as Dumonia continues to struggle to regain its footing after losing so much, the Albrian elite have ceased the opportunity to squeeze the Crown for more and more freedoms. In more recent times leading to the establishment of 'Albriar' as closer to a state-within-a-state instead of an Imperial holding. The Avalorean people thus enjoy far more autonomy in the Empire than its many other subjects currently; a fact which has caused great envy across the Empire... for if the Avaloreans can demand so much from the Crown, why can't they as well?"

  AUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Order of the Sun is a dominion within the Dumonian Empire. It is a small, although powerful, semi-independent theocratic state that serves as the centre of the faith for the Cult of the Sun. The state is said to be guided directly by Holy Kamiros, Lord of Light, with the high priest merely acting as their interpreter. The Bright Judge works to uphold this righteous land as a haven for all believers by driving away darkness and spreading his divine nature through his holy word. This sacred land is a beacon for all who seek Kamiros and his teachings."
  YAN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Yanger Nomads are a people hailing from the the vast steppes of the western reaches of Noricum. Historically, these lands were a former imperial province of Dumonia, the land ripe for wealthy Dumonian ranchers.  However, it was not the wealthy Dumonian landowner who would come to rule the steppe; but the horselords of the Yanger and their riders.  Now, Dumonia has retreated to its' heartland, and these steppes lay in control of men hardened by war. With much talk of magic and the return of the gods, people look for an answer. In the eternal skies of the steppes exists a chaotic storm, serving as a prophecy for the many religious of forthcoming change. The steppe-riders lie prepared to weather the storm once more."
  RVC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Midnight Court, Dreadmoor. A nation purely born from the Chaos of the Nightfall and the failure of Men. A state managed by Arch Vampires, the corrupt and fallen brethren of the Sunkissed. The humans which dwell in these lands are sickly and pale by nature, unhealthy and often short lived as their Vampire Masters view them as nothing more than cattle. Their bodies and souls nothing more than resources to be expended as seen fit by Vampires for they are potent Mages naturally.  Reviled by all and for good reason the Midnight Magocracy has isolated itself from the world. A land of mystery now to the Human nations around it Dreadmoor year by year becomes more of a threat to peace in Southern Noricum. The Vampire Lords are a greedy caste, and they will stop at nothing to extend their reach over more and more unwitting souls of which to dominate, corrupt, and expend. The question remains, do they have the cunning required to achieve their goals? Or will their greed be their undoing against the stout hearts of men?"

  DRK_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Drysgolmark is a Jalian exclave situated on the fringes of the Yanger Steppes born from Jalian colonization from the South hundreds of years ago. The small amount of woodlands to its West forming a natural barrier which prevented Yanger tribes from attempting to settle the territory out of inconvenience. It is a densely populated city-state in current day that has in recent years fallen under the direct influence of Foxworth to its south. The larger Jalian state setting its gaze on the creation of a larger cultural union of Jalian people. Drysgolmark has thus become the first domino to fall in regard to Foxworth's plans. But that does not mean it cannot carve out a niche in the rising power's fledgling Empire. Rise, Drygolites! The time has come to show those Foxworthers that you are a prize to be cherished, not a stepping stone!"
  JUR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Inquisitor calls upon the flame of the mighty, holy Kamiros, God of light. He calls unto the bright judge to vanquish all whom sin heinously under the cover of night. This land has incurred the punishment of the nightbane, and Jurian answers the call. With fanatic fervor, he has established a foothold for the inquisition to carry out retribution and return these green pastures to the righteous. This expedition will prove his faith and spread the truth of Kamiros to the ignorant. But most important of all the oncoming campaign will once and for all exonerate the Sunkissed of their failure to protect Stonewise decades ago. Specifically through the complete and utter purification of Dreadmoor and the extinction of this so-called 'Midnight Court'."

  DOV_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Dovedale, once a collection of minor provinces within the Empire, is primarily populated by Jalians. Its dense woodlands served as a natural barrier between the Empire's heartland and its eastern holdings. Despite their unimportant economic status, the Jalians thrived until the Nightfall, when magical calamities shook the region. With the Empire stretched thin, the plight of Dovedale was neglected, leading to a popular uprising for independence. The Jalians banded together to combat the encroaching darkness, fighting a long, bloody, and costly war against magical beasts and mutants. The ends justified the means and by the end of this decades-long conflict 'Dovedale' would stand as the de-facto safest land in Noricum. Ironically right above perhaps the most dangerous place in all of Noricum; Dreadmoor..."
  ROF_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Rosecroft is yet another breakaway state in Southern Noricum. Initially the Rosecroftans had withdrawn from the mainland when the Nightfall ensued. The monstrous new wildlife proved too much for them and the last resort was pulling away to Caecarw which overcrowded the peninsula. This fact eventually leading to a small 'crusade' by Rosecroft's leadership to establish a beachhead on the mainland once more a decade later. The attempt saw success and a militarized holding in Bancfan was established. Decades have since passed as Rosecroft continues to exist in relative peace...however the arrival of the Inquisition to the South and the recent activity of Dreadmoor to the north leaves Rosecroft in a precarious position! Even more pressingly it seems agents of the Inquisition and the Midnight Magocracy have both entered the nation and begun a secret war upon one another already on Rosecroftan land..."
  FOX_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Foxworth, the former administrative capital of the Dumonian Empire's Eastern Noric provinces and cultural heart of the Jalian people. Initially loyal to the Crown during the Viceroy's war,  Foxworth joined the growing list of provinces breaking away from the Empire as supernatural incursions ravaged the land and requests for aid remained unanswered. This decision was not made easily as Foxworth pushed itself to its breaking point before Dovedale's revolt finally broke the back of the province and forced it to look out for its own citizens. The Jalians believed wholly in the Dumonian Empire. But those times have long since passed as nearly 40 years have come and gone since Foxworth declared itself independent. Much of the population no longer remembers the times of the Empire and a strong sense of Patriotism is felt by the Foxworth Jalians. The politics of Dunefield have begun deeper interests in Imperialism as a result. Already the Jalians of Drysgolmark has fallen beneath the thumb of Foxworth's influence...and yet still there is more cultural kin to be brought into the fold. But first one thing has become abundantly clear; Dreadmoor is becoming an issue that can no longer be ignored..."

  BIE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Brackenshire is the birthplace of the Nivaskyan people, a Northern Noric culture that is famed for its resilience to the elements and hardship as well as its prowess in fishing and seafaring. During the height of the Empire's reach, Brackenshire narrowly avoided domination through the wide swathes of land occupied by their Yanger cousins, and through the deep pockets of their investor's guild. The Empire's wane in the decades since has allowed Brackenshire to slowly assert itself more firmly as a regional power. Dumonia no longer has the presence necessary to threaten potential imperialist interests... and the capitalists of Crystalbrook have already begun buying out the industry of the horselords to the south. Meanwhile, their kin of the North, Mistbourne lie ripe to be pressured into political union and even further north lie the land of Half-Giants...\n\nWill the Brackenshire Investor's Guild stand tall, or find itself subject to hostile takeover?"
  MBR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Many, many centuries ago Nivaski settlers set out from the Bracken peninsula to colonize the lands of the north. In the times of the Empire it was a rather lawless region of the far north. Too problematic to bother settling or conquering. Not much has changed in that field even today beyond a more settled soceity as well as possessing a potent squidding industry which supplies dyes to Northern Noricum. Still. The Nivaski of Mistbourne are proud of their humble stature. They etch out an honest life in the chilly north and are far from any real threat to its national integrity. Though, its cousins in Brackenshire call for the unity of the Nivaski people...will Mistbourne answer the call? Beyond that there lays strange reports from the northern reaches of the country. Strange beasts emerging from the Whistling Summits and the sightings of stout humanoids who's skin is as black as tar itself. A cause for concern potentially and source of potential pressure to agree towards Crystalbrook's pressures for unity..."
  EVR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Everglen is a relatively secluded exclave of Avalorean people that was fortunate enough to escape the reach of Crownpeak during the Nightfall. Its local geography left it benefitting little from being part of the Imperial economy, leaving the Avaloreans of Everglen paying tribute to the Crown for no real benefit. Independence was a no-brainer once the opportunity presented itself! Still, token contact is made between Albrian and Everglenian traders which exchange gossip and goods alike. In recent times its local lake has begun being exploited for wishstone and magic has slowly begun to penetrate into the Everglenian economy which might serve to springboard it from an irrelevant rump state to a center of magical learning in the far reaches of northern Noricum."

  AHO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Despite the Nightfall, despite the Changeling epidemic, despite the Viceroy's War, despite all obstacles Achon stands as a beacon of Magical Learning and Enlightment in the world. Despite its distance from the rich heartlands of Arrador Achon still can attest to its intellectual primacy. While the Magelords of Achon eagerly point to this fact as evidence of the superiority of Achonite minds, it is not entirely honest. The Vynduri dwarves of Mount Vyndervoht played a crucial role in nurturing the first generations of Achonite Mages that would come to power in a shattered Achon after the Nightfall. The Mages of Achon did not simply happen upon their knowledge, it was graciously given to them by their Vynduri neighbors. This reality is a state guarded secret and would undermine the patriotic rhetoric of Achon Magelords if it was public knowledge. As the saying goes, 'History is written by the victors' and Achon will ensure it will write the history of its achievements. History WILL remember the ACHONITE perception of Changelings. Of the glory of Achonite culture and intrigue. Of its moral superiority over the decadent Dorites of Arrador. The culture of Achon is sublime and the world will know this...one way or another."
  ARR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "[Country.GetFlavorText]"
  EBR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Republic of Ebridor stands as a humble entity along Settler Coast's northern coastline. The blowback of the Nightfall sent waves throughout Ebridor but the overall impact was moderate at best compared to neighboring Achon which suffered immensely in the aftermath. The Viceroy's War which transpired around this time also impacted Ebridor to a minimal extent. Both refusing the call to arms by the Emperor and swiftly declaring both its independence from Dumonia as well as its neutrality in the war Arrador waged against it. Arrador, ever savvy-minded for business accepted this and promptly established warm relations with the fresh Republic. The passing decades after saw a steady influx of Achonite Mages cross over into Ebridor and expose the Eberri people to magic in a non-terrifying manner. Magic has thus become a hot topic in Eberri society recently and is taking a notable role in the politics of the nation. Only time will tell if this marks the beginning of a political shakeup in the otherwise progressive merchant state as Achonite Mages spread their teachings to Aspirant Eberri Artificers from their holdings in Twotor. Will the Republic's foundations survive? Or will it fall and Ebridor transition to more...authoritarian forms of governance?"
  PFL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Pefril is an enigmatic realm of changelings, planetouched humans gifted with the ability to shift their appearance. Pefril is a nation born out of a rejection to oppression over the nature of the Changeling people. Banding together in the Hinterlands of what was once Achonite land and forming a nation state for the sake of freedom for Changelings and freedom to express their powers. But this freedom comes with a price, their now distant cousins, humans, carry a deep distrust for Changelings. Leading to a rejection and complete lack of recognition of the Pefrilan state by its neighbors.\n\nTo its north, the Magocracy of Achon eyes Pefril with a disdainful gaze. Viewing the country to be nothing more than a nation of squatters sitting upon rightful Achon territory. It is unlikely that there will ever be reconciliation with the Achonites...especially considering their continued oppression of Changelings unfortunate enough to be under their thumb. Hope however lies to the South as the Astral Consortium is a League of coin and and innovation, not tradition and pride. Perhaps the way to recognition and acceptance is a display of ingenuity to the Consortium? Membership would be a large boon to the fledgling nation..."
  VHT_FLAVOR_TEXT: "From the depths of Mount Vyndervoht the Vynduri Dwarves stirred some years prior to the Nightfall. The Archmages of their society awakening far ahead of the rest of Dwarvenkind. But they did not choose to spring from their mountain home, instead keeping to the protection of their sacred halls. Content to safeguard the collection of their culture's knowledge and conduct magical experiments from the safety of their mountain. The lack of practiced magic in the world pleased the Vynduri Archmages to a degree as they discovered that magic had returned to the world.\n\nQuietly they made use of it...and in doing so they came to discover that Khuus had begun its secretive exploitation of magic. Sensing a disaster was soon to come, the Vynduri Mages set about preparations for such an event. Chief among this was subtly attempting to aid the neighboring Achonites as much as possible as the Vynduri had developed cordial relations with these men of reason. As expected the Nightfall transpired and the world was wounded mortally. In the advent of the destruction the Vynduri formally ended their isolationism and set out to deepen their ties with the Achonite peoples as the rest of Vynduri society arose from their entombment. Their desire to learn struck a cord with the Vynduri and thus the troves of Vyndervoht were opened to the select few Achonites who were allowed to learn mystical arts. This act would pave the way for the generations of Mages that rule Achon today. Currently Vyndervoht sits as a junior partner in an economic union with the Achonites. The Vynduri have benefitted greatly from this relation and there is lies little reason to break away from Achon. Especially when considering the disdain the Dwarves possess for Changelings...impure creatures wrought by the Nightfall and a perpetual reminder of the disaster brought on by the misuse of magic."
  CER_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Arrador's victory against the Dumonian Empire during the Viceroy's War divorced Ceraun from the Empire against its own will.

Through ingenuity, they overcame environmental hurdles through by utilizing mountaintop glaciers for water in combination with mountainside terrace farms.\nMore recently, the arrival of the Aridrun elves has sparked a renaissance for both the dwarves and the newcomers. The two races find themselves complementing each other in culture, trade and politics. The Chimesilt trade, previously an odd niche of the Nogi Sands, has made the region very wealthy thanks to an ever-growing demand abroad.\nWill the airships flying the routes of the 'Silt Wind" herald a new future for the Vozmead Peaks, or will history remember them as the beginning of a dark turn in dwarven history?"

They've since become hardened by the Nogi desert they've come to inhabit, where they've dug intricate subterranean settlements and take advantage of the chimesilt trade with their dwarvern Vozi friends.\n\nThe Aridrun have recently sent emissaries to the other elves of Zalaron, offering riches and knowledge from the south as tokens of friendship. Their goals are noble, but none can deny that these are missionary expeditions in search of new followers — and in search of their lost goddess.\n\nWill the people of the Nogi unite for a better future or turn against eachother for their own pursits?"

They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like.\n\nThere has always been an elite force of spies and assassins within Rannor, known to few. Only special clients — nobles, merchant lords, and the like — have access to these spies.

  TEF_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The High elves of Teferet have long been known for their magical prowess, and their expertise in magic has made them one of the most sought-after groups of magical artisans in the world. When the Nightfall ravaged Khus and the surrounding area, the lands of Teferet were suffused with latent magic. This proved too much for most of the humans residing there, leading to a mass exodus of those who had no latent magical ability.\n\nBy quickly settling the sparsely populated land, the Tefereti elves seized this opportunity to call a single land their home since the age of gods. The magically-infused Lake Eutrater in the area empowered many of the elves with magic, allowing them to regain the powers of old. Although most of the remaining humans in the area are magically inclined, the elves are not quick to forget their mistreatment at the hands of humans and refuse to treat them equally.\n\nRecently, the subjugation of the Wood elves living in the Feylight Forest by the human nation of Thiral has caused outrage within the local poulation. Many have began demanding their leaders take action and free the elves from human rule. However, there are whispers that factions within Teferet may be pursuing darker magical secrets to put an end to actions like this in the area. There are fears that this could lead to a dangerous conflict with other nations if it were to be uncovered."

However, those days are long gone. Today, Thiral resists the loud, ugly, and dirty advancements of metal and magic embraced by its neighbors. During a recent expansion northward, Thiralians encountered elves who were not the legendary paragons of beauty but primitive hut-dwellers, allowing the Feylight Forest to fester.

  PRI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Prilyra is the famed breadbasket of the Settler's Coast. During the Viceroy's war, Prilyra had remained loyal to the empire, the sleepy rural communities saw little reason in marching from their homes for so-called 'Independence'. Unfortunately for them, they chose the losing side of that war. Swarmed over by the Rebelling provinces and promptly forced into the Astral Consortium that formed following Dumonia's defeat. A gentle hand during the occupation kept relations with the Prilyran people at a calm state. Decades have passed since and little has changed for the Wealder people of Prilyra. They are a simple farming society and above all simply wish to be left alone. The world can change as much as it pleases, for Prilyrans? As long as harvests are good, life is good and they will fight to guarantee that if needed."
  KRC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The province of Mistreach has long been a vital crossroads between Arrador and Emparal. The flow of goods helped solidify the "Mistreachan" provincial identity and its dependence on both Emparal and Arrador left it with no choice but to side with them during the Viceroy's War. Despite this, Emparal would still cast its shadow of influence over Mistreach in the coming decades after the war. Culminating in establishing a Personal Union and renaming it to the Principality of Kracia instead. For the people of Mistreach it remains unlikely they will ever have true self-determination. Though...Settler's Coast's relatively quiet political situation seems to be on the verge of an upheaval with its orchestrators yet to be revealed. Perhaps 'Kracia' can find opportunity to the South of Lake Bossard or maybe even at the peaks of Mount Yelfis? Kracia may yet be able to ride this tide of change...or perhaps it will be drowned beneath it?"

Today Emparal continues to prosper as one of the richest nations along Settler's Coast. Will it settle for remaining in its 'Big Brother's' shadow to the North or will it carve out an Empire to the South? It faces a slew of issues such as the Orcs to their southern frontier and monitoring the developing political situation of the Darvak dwarves to its North. One wrong move could potentially undo decades of prosperity for the enlightened Bossardi state..."

Decades later, this early necessity of curiosity has paid off handily as Darvak now stands as a giant of industry in the region. It now stands at the precipice of yet another massive societal shift as Yelfie leaders compete to carve out Darvak's path as an regional powerhouse...or perhaps something even greater?"

#West Zalaron
  RAV_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Gnomes of Ravik were once a simple, primitive society. This stature left them open to the expansionism of their southern Human neighbors, Thaloria. Pushed to the coast and oppressed for decades these Gnomes felt no other choice but to embrace the Dark Art of Necromancy when one of their own discovered its secrets, Hasal Nezzelech. Through hate in their hearts for Mankind and their exploitation of the dead, the Raviki have formed a powerful Meritocracy which has surged past that of the decadent Thalorians and handed these brazen fools defeat after defeat. Already two successful Crusades against this abhorrent Empire have come and gone, and the third begins on this day to finally shatter these ancient oppressors of the Gnomish people. The Soulwrought are ready to prove their worth to their creators to join Raviki society and the Gnomes of Ravik stand united to dissolve Thaloria and bring about the the Gnomish Age in Fraesoh! Onwards! The Age of Men is finished!"

Already two 'Crusades' waged by the Raviki have seen success and shattered the western part of Thaloria. Eager to finish the job, the Raviki have begun their Third and potentially final Crusade against the remnants of Thaloria. West Thaloria may be currently lost but there is still hope in the East. As Raviki troops and Soulwrought Battle-thralls march on Thaloria there will be no shortage of patriots willing to lay down their lives for the sake of Thaloria. The Lacustrines are committed to preserving their proud heritage and repelling these foul Necromantic Gnomes! Onwards! For Thaloria! The Age of Men will never end!"
