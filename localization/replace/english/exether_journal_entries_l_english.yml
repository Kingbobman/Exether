  je_thalorian_crusade: "Third Thalorian Crusade"
  je_thalorian_crusade_reason: "The Thalorian Crusades mark a series of brutal conflicts between the gnomes and Thalorian humans. The first crusade began when Hasal Nezzelech taught the gnomes the dark art of necromancy, empowering them to repel human incursions and reclaim their sacred woods. This initial victory emboldened the gnomes and left the Thalorians reeling.\n\nIn the second crusade, the gnomes unleashed the Soulwrought—resurrected humans encased in metal bodies—against the Thalorian forces. The devastation was immense, fracturing the western reaches of the Thalorian Empire and leaving a scar on the land and its people.\n\nINow, the third crusade ignites, with the gnomes determined to dismantle what remains of the Eastern Thalorian Empire. As both sides prepare for another brutal confrontation, the fate of the empire hangs in the balance, and the echoes of past conflicts threaten to shape the future in unforeseen ways."
