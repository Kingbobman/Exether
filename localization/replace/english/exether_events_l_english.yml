  blood_tribunal.8.t: "Detestable Harvest"
  blood_tribunal.8.a: ""Perhaps we can try vegetarianism?""
  blood_tribunal.8.d: "For reasons difficult to surmise, this year's tithe is near completely inedible."
  blood_tribunal.8.f: ""Even their youngest and strongest are so-afflicted.  The flavor is tainted by dread and despair, turning thick and cold as though curdled by the very air itself.""
  blood_tribunal.9.t: "Seditious Rumors"
  blood_tribunal.9.a: "We will not lend credence to the stories of rumormongers."
  blood_tribunal.9.b: "The peasants must be kept in line."
  blood_tribunal.9.d: "This year's tithe is plagued by whispers and silent protests."
  blood_tribunal.9.f: "The word "vampire" is being spoken in hushed whispers in the rural taverns. In the cities, streets that once bustled into the night grow silent after sunset."

stepping_forward.1.a: "The lords of the steppe are not dead yet."
stepping_forward.1.d: "The once-proud nomads of Yanger now find themselves facing encroachment on all sides."
stepping_forward.1.f: "The nomadic lifestyle of the Yanger people has become a liability as [SCOPE.sCountry('dovedale_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] farmers form permanent settlements in the south and [SCOPE.sCountry('brackenshire_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] capitalists buy out what little industry exists in the north.  Meanwhile, the [GetCulture('dumonian').GetName] vulture looms."
stepping_forward.2.t: "The Rising Stallion"
stepping_forward.2.d: "With the passing of [GetLawType('law_industry_banned').GetName], we are finally in a position to secure both our economy and our rural way of life."
stepping_forward.2.f: ""And so the following lands will be appropriated and earmarked for grazing, ranching, and other agricultural efforts, both public and private.  They are to remain untouched by any efforts either foreign or industrial.  The punishment for any individual or conglomerate found to be in violation of this proceeding...""

stepping_forward.3.b: "We will get them 'in touch' with 'local investors'."
stepping_forward.4.t: "Kids These Days"
stepping_forward.4.d: "More and more young people are moving to the cities for work, leaving many of the tribes unable to find suitable replacements for retiring riders."
stepping_forward.4.f: ""When I was your age, I could shoot a Dumonian square in the chest while riding backwards on a horse.  Will your son learn to shoot?  Will your daughter learn to ride?""

stepping_forward.7.t: "No Country for Old Men"

stepping_forward.7.f: ""My daughter has married a [SCOPE.sCountry('dovedale_scope').GetNameNoFlag] farmer and my son works in a [SCOPE.sCountry('brackenshire_scope').GetNameNoFlag] factory.  What is to become of our way of life?  I fear...""
stepping_forward.7.a: ""...Our children have forgotten how to ride.""
stepping_forward.8.t: "Return on Investment"
stepping_forward.8.d: "With the seizure of all foreign-owned assets, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] have finally established dominion over their own lands."
stepping_forward.8.f: "While the settlements and manufactories the colonizers constructed still exist, no longer will they be ran by nefarious actors outside the control of our riders.

stepping_forward.10.t: "The Bucking Bronco"
stepping_forward.10.d: "Despite years of buyouts and backhanded deals, we have been forced out of the [SCOPE.sCountry('yanger_scope').GetAdjective] economy."
stepping_forward.10.f: "The Brackenshire Investor's Guild is in shambles after the loss of their holdings on the steppe. They have returned to Kenlyne with their tails tucked between their legs. The few who have not been rendered penniless have begun to move what little capital they have left to greener pastures."
stepping_forward.10.a: ""You mean we have to work for a living?""
  pirate_raid.2.t: "Pilfering Treasures"
  pirate_raid.2.d: "With our combined efforts, the ravager fleets were able to execute an attack on a Dumonian gold fleet as it anchored off the shores of the Coves. The ships and cargo have been seized. The former will be pressed into service, the latter is filling our coffers."
  pirate_raid.2.f: "Nobody saw the small boats approach the fleet in the depth of the night. By the time the alarm was raised, the escort detail had already been brought to heel. Faced with a Bonetider's pistol at her temple and with her marines caught off-guard, the captain was forced to make the prudent choice of relinquishing her command and open the magically locked cargo containers in exchange for the crewmembers' lives. As the Dumonians paddled their way to the distant lights of the Cove Colony, the pirates beheld the neatly stacked bars of gold. Each one stamped with the sigil of the South Sea Company. The Emperor would not be amused."
  pirate_raid.2.a: "Gold for the treasury!"
  pirate_raid.2.b: "Ships for the fleet!"

  pirate_raid.21.t: "Troubles on the South Sea"
  pirate_raid.21.d: "Our lack of naval assets has allowed the various pirate groups of the South Sea to slip past our patrols and execute a raid on one of our treasure fleets. The cargo was lost and rumours swirl about the ships being outfitted to conduct further raids. An embarassing failure of the Emperor's plans in the region and something we can not allow to stand!"
  pirate_raid.21.f: "Was it merely a temporary setback? Or a troubling sign that the Emperor's promises would come with more obstacles than the speeches and proclamations had ever admitted to? The investor class of Merchant Bay certainly suspected the latter. They had substantial assets riding on these colonial ventures. Pirates sharpening sabres and loading their pistols didn't look good on the risk assesment reports."
  pirate_raid.21.a: "How dare they?!"

  pirate_raid.3.t: "A Night on the Town with the Lads"
  pirate_raid.3.d: "Our newly combined raiding forces have smashed through the Cove Colony's defenses. Their island capital was sacked and set alight, it's treasury plundered and we have seized twelve ships that were too slow to escape us. How should we divide these spoils?"
  pirate_raid.3.f: "The vote came out roughly 3-1. As the flames of the colony tinted the night sky red, the show of hands decided the fate of the barrel of rum in their middle: Immediate execution by method of communal consumption. Bonetider, Serpent or Corsair, tonight, the distinctions vanished in a haze of booze and well-directed violence. Would this state last? Only time could tell."
  pirate_raid.3.a: "Uphold the Pirate's Code: Equal distribution of spoils!"
  pirate_raid.3.b: "We DID do most of the work here..."

  pirate_raid.31.t: "And Night of Grief and Fire"
  pirate_raid.31.d: "A pirate force far more coordinated than what we had previously thought possible has laid waste to our Cove Colony's capital. Most of it's treasures and many of the anchored ships have been seized, not to mention the widespread loss of life."
  pirate_raid.31.f: "The survivors spoke of a all three pirate bands working in concert. Of their callous pillaging of the peaceful colony. Sympathetic head nods all over polite society, but they all knew the real questions: What would be done to prevent more threats to their investments? And more importantly: Who would foot the bill for this one?"
  pirate_raid.31.a: "We will pay our fair share of the costs."
  pirate_raid.31.b: "We will pay for all the damages."
  pirate_raid.31.c: "We will pay for nothing. The Colony is responsible."

  pirate_devil.1.t: "The Devil's Due"
  pirate_devil.1.d: "In the dark of night, the pact with one of the devil brothers looms over us like a storm on the horizon. We have two choices: pay the agreed-upon tribute of 100000 in gold or let the devil feast on a portion of our population as repayment."
  pirate_devil.1.f: "Fear spreads across the lands as our undue debt has been kindly reminded. The gold demanded is immense, but the cost of defiance may be even higher. Should we risk our people, or our treasure?"
  pirate_devil.1.a: "Pay the devil's due"
  pirate_devil.1.b: "The devil's hunger knows no bounds"

  pirate_raid.1.a: "[SCOPE.sCountry('raid_dum').GetName] shall bleed once more!"

  pirate_raid.1.d: "The pirate captains have gathered to discuss their next target. Who shall be the unlucky victim of their next raid?"
  pirate_raid.1.f: "We have once more gathered to discuss our next target. The captains have made their suggestions, and now it is time to decide who shall be the next to feel the wrath of the pirate fleets."

  pirate_raid.4.t: "Raid Failed"
  pirate_raid.4.d: "Our raiding forces have been repelled by the defenders of the [SCOPE.sCountry('target_country').GetName]. The pirates have been forced to retreat, leaving behind a number of their own and a few ships."
  pirate_raid.4.f: "The defenders of [SCOPE.sCountry('target_country').GetName] have proven themselves to be a formidable foe. The pirates were forced to retreat, leaving behind a number of their own and a few ships. The captains are furious at the loss, and are eager to make the [SCOPE.sCountry('target_country').GetAdjective] pay for their insolence."
  pirate_raid.4.a: "We will have our revenge!"
