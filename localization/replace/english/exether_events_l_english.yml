 everfrost_expedition.101.f: "Whispers echo through the hallowed halls of the world's most prestigious academies, as the allure of unraveling one of the greatest mysteries in history becomes irresistible.\n\nDeep in the heart of Everfrost, beyond the forbidding Gruaav Mountains, lies the fabled land of Bremala, believed to be the birthplace of giants. Yet, despite the legends, many question whether this mythical realm exists at all, or if it's merely a story spun from ancient lore."
 everfrost_expedition.101.a: "I know just the man for the job."
 everfrost_expedition.101.b: "Can the treasury bear such an expense?"
 
 everfrost_expedition.102.t: "Untempered by the Cold"
 everfrost_expedition.102.d: "We must choose a leader for the upcoming expedition to the Everfrost. A few promising candidates have distinguished themselves."
 everfrost_expedition.102.f: "Few people are capable of rightly appreciating this heroic deed, this brilliant proof of human courage and energy. These men will venture right into the heart of the pack ice and razworwinds, which all previous explorers have regarded as certain death. These men are heroes — heroes in the highest sense of the word."
 everfrost_expedition.102.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('expedition_leader_1').GetFullName] is an experienced explorer."
 everfrost_expedition.102.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('expedition_leader_2').GetFullName] will lead us to glory."

 everfrost_expedition.102.e: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('expedition_leader_4').GetFullName] is the most prepared one."
 
 everfrost_expedition.1.t: "The Crown of the World"
 everfrost_expedition.1.d: "The expedition spots the lowest peak of the Gruaav range on the horizon, Mount Krutum. Runestones assert that the cliffs tend to be plagued by terrible storms. Thankfully we find the mountains at peace." #Krutum means Long Horn
 everfrost_expedition.1.f: ""They rose starkly into the northern sky, revealing an array of impossibly high mountain peaks. The crystalline snowflakes danced in the air, refracting light and creating a dreamlike quality. Against the backdrop of shimmering ice-dust clouds, the peaks inspired a curious sense of fantasy, their jagged silhouettes glowing in the ethereal light.""
 everfrost_expedition.1.a: "We should move on quickly."
 everfrost_expedition.1.b: "Collect geological samples."
 everfrost_expedition.1.c: "Ascend Mount Krutum. We will be the first to reach Bremala!"

 everfrost_expedition.2.t: "Halfway Hut"
 everfrost_expedition.2.d: "The expedition disembarks upon the frozen shore of the Everfrost. At a relatively accessible location, a crewman suggests constructing a durable hut where we could rest and leave supplies for the return journey, and perhaps even for future explorers."
 everfrost_expedition.2.d2: "The expedition disembarks upon the frozen shore of the Everfrost, and is welcomed by the reassuring sight of a wooden hut. Only slightly snowed-in, it is easily made habitable and the crew discover ample supplies of food within."
 everfrost_expedition.2.f: ""The temperature of the hut is low, of course, but in every other respect we are absolutely comfortable. There is an unlimited quantity of biscuit, and our discovery at Pram Point means an unlimited supply of seal meat. An empty kerosene tin and some firebricks have been made into an excellent little stove, which has been connected to the old stove-pipe. Already we can regard it as a temporary home."" #Scott
 everfrost_expedition.2.a: "This hut shall stand the test of time."
 everfrost_expedition.2.b: "The hut need only last until our return."
 everfrost_expedition.2.c: "We should rest and resupply before moving on."

 everfrost_expedition.3.t: "Missed the Mark"
 everfrost_expedition.3.d: "The expedition has realized that they have overshot on their route towards the next supply depot."
 everfrost_expedition.3.f: ""As we continued our way through the merciless white, snow cairns had become more and more scarce. Or that we thought. "It's almost evening." We all stopped. "Do we have enough food?," I managed to ask. We all knew the answer, we all knew why I was asking. A single nod, no one talked. We all knew that those lies were as white as this land.""
 everfrost_expedition.3.f2: ""As we continued our way through the merciless white, snow cairns had become more and more scarce. Or that we thought. God help us, we can't keep up this pulling, that is certain. Amongst ourselves we are unending cheerful, but what each man feels in his heart I can only guess."" #Scott
 everfrost_expedition.3.a: "We need those supplies. Turn back."
 everfrost_expedition.3.b: "Push on, we can do without the supplies."
 
 everfrost_expedition.4.t: "The End Is Near"
 everfrost_expedition.4.d: "The expedition is doomed. Utterly exhausted, frostbitten, and out of supplies, all that is left to do is await the cold embrace of death."
 everfrost_expedition.4.f: ""Every day we have been ready to start for our depot 11 miles away, but outside the door of the tent it remains a scene of whirling drift. I do not think we can hope for any better things now. We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far. It seems a pity but I do not think I can write more."\n\n"For God's sake look after our people."" #Scott
 everfrost_expedition.4.a: "I am just going outside and may be some time."
 
 everfrost_expedition.5.t: "The Ice Wall"
 everfrost_expedition.5.d: "The expedition has reached its destination: the South Pole! [SCOPE.sCharacter('expedition_leader').GetFullName] proudly erects a tent bearing the [SCOPE.sCountry('expedition_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] flag, and the crew drink a celebratory mug of cocoa."
 everfrost_expedition.5.d2: "The expedition reaches the South Pole only to find a tent bearing the [SCOPE.sCountry('pole_winner_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] flag. We have been beaten to our goal!"
 everfrost_expedition.5.f: ""Bremala. Colossal, silent. The ice shimmered with an unnatural glow, as if the very glacier concealed a pulse beneath its surface. Beneath our trembling boots, an empire of frost, ancient and frozen, awaited discovery. The wall stretched beyond sight, towering and endless. Lifeless, but real.""
 everfrost_expedition.5.f2: "We've found what can only be Bremala, encased in a monumental wall of ice. Its grandeur is undeniable, yet the sight is soured by a lone tent flying the [SCOPE.sCountry('pole_winner_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] flag. We've been beaten to our prize!"
 everfrost_expedition.5.a: "Success! But now the hard journey home begins..."
 everfrost_expedition.5.b: "Damnation! And now the hard journey home begins..."
 
 everfrost_expedition.6.t: "Dog Meat"
 everfrost_expedition.6.d: "Supplies are running low for the explorers in the heart of the Everfrost. The crew debates the merits of killing some of the sled dogs, and dividing the meat between the men and the remaining dogs to increase their odds of survival."
 everfrost_expedition.6.f: ""One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions."\n\n"We have agreed to shrink from nothing to achieve our goal! And besides if we do not do this, the dogs will surely die from malnutrition or exhaustion regardless."" #Scott
 everfrost_expedition.6.a: "It is the practical thing to do."
 everfrost_expedition.6.b: "We will not stoop to such barbarism!"

 everfrost_expedition.7.d2: "The crew of the Everfrost expedition have finally returned home. As the first men ever to reach Bremala, they are lauded as [SCOPE.sCountry('expedition_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] heroes."
 everfrost_expedition.7.f: ""Glory. Victory. Cheers and parades. Absurd sums of money. Kind words. The repetition of the hero's shadow over one's own name. The crew. That precious group of indomitable bastards. Home. Days. Nights. How much I had missed the days and the nights, their calculated succession. The boredom of the routine. Waking up on my bed. Hot chocolate. Coffee. Tea. My favorite tartlets. How much I had missed the noise from this street.""

 everfrost_expedition.8.t: "Pack Ice"
 everfrost_expedition.8.d: "Broken pieces of sea ice start to cover the surface of the water as the expedition approaches its destination. The ship's hull tries to make its way through the cold mass by ramming and crushing, but the ice becomes stronger as they advance."
 everfrost_expedition.8.f: ""It wouldn't be sound to confess that such a peril intrigued me, but the imminent arrival of our final goal, announced by the increasing sea ice that surrounded us, could not but terrify and fascinate me at the same time. The snow cover that extended over it had prevented the sea from reflecting our silhouettes or our ship's — there was nothing else to see: it was just us, and Bremala.""
 everfrost_expedition.8.a: "Onwards!"
 everfrost_expedition.8.b: "We have to trust [SCOPE.sCharacter('expedition_leader').GetFullName]'s expertise."

 everfrost_expedition.9.t: "Icebound"
 everfrost_expedition.9.d: "A series of pressure waves struck the expedition's ship, causing the ice around it to separate into large pieces. A moment of victory is quickly followed by two floes being pinched on her starboard side, one at her bow and one at her stern. The crew gathers as they make a plan to free her."
 everfrost_expedition.9.d2: "Blasting a path through the pack ice proved to be a Sisyphean task. Worse, the encroaching ice is crushing the ship. Even if it were possible to free her from the ice, she is no longer seaworthy. The only remaining option is to abandon ship and hope to find a whaling outpost on foot."
 everfrost_expedition.9.f: ""The cold had reached us. The planks of antique oaks were now shyly hidden behind snow-laden layers of white, and the whole ship would have seemed deserted if it wasn't for the tremulous lights that we had managed to keep lit. The ice was engulfing us, and with its natural grace started to stab our precious shelter.""
 everfrost_expedition.9.a: "We'll blast through the ice!"
 everfrost_expedition.9.b: "Abandon ship."
 
 everfrost_expedition.10.t: "Whaling Station"
 everfrost_expedition.10.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('expedition_leader').GetFullName] has successfully led the expeditionary crew to a whaling station on South Georgia, braving the journey from Elephant Island in an uncovered lifeboat with meager supplies. Tales of [SCOPE.sCharacter('expedition_leader').GetFirstName]'s heroism resound throughout the nation despite the failure of the expedition."
 everfrost_expedition.10.f: ""During our last night camping under the ruthless white, our cook had asked me if it had been a tough decision, "going back," he had said, "after making it so far, wasn't it hard?". No, I wanted to say. No, it wasn't.\n\nWhat joy could Bremala bring to a man, trapped between the sea and the mountain ranges, a starving silhouette of fog and cold? If the dry air had blown slightly stronger, we would all had dispelled, like diaphanous flakes of snow.""
 everfrost_expedition.10.a: "Three cheers for [SCOPE.sCharacter('expedition_leader').GetFullName]!"

 everfrost_expedition.11.t: "The Great Ice Barrier"
 everfrost_expedition.11.d: "As the expedition's ship turns to the side, the crew witnesses in awe a high, perpendicular face of ice; their only entrance to the continent."
 everfrost_expedition.11.f: ""And there it stood. If it had a face, I know it'd be laughing at us. That ridiculous cracking sound — the ice breaking. And there it goes, there, a block falls into the sea. Threatening. Fatal. It's in the direction of our ship. This moment had haunted our minds since when we left the last harbor. Sailing had been difficult, but going into that uncharted continent would be like descending into the depths of a frozen hell.""
 everfrost_expedition.11.a: "We must climb it!"
 everfrost_expedition.11.b: "We should make a detour around the fissures."
 
 everfrost_expedition.12.t: "The Gruaav Mountains"
 everfrost_expedition.12.d: "The expedition has advanced through eternal days of snow marching until finding the impenetrable sight of the Gruaav Range. A new challenge awaits, as their routes have been scarcely documented."
 everfrost_expedition.12.f: ""The ever-gray sky had left us in a state of cruel anesthesia, incapable of discerning the line that separated snow from atmosphere, snow from footprints, snow from us. A sharper gray was laid before us, and in its numbness resided a familiar comfort.\n\nThe wall of stone was covered in white, and it took us most of the day to understand that it was no vertical sky, no heaven falling upon us, the final chant, the doomed trumpets, a mirage. Those were mountains.""
 everfrost_expedition.12.a: "We'll find a new route."
 everfrost_expedition.12.b: "We'll be taking a known approach."
 
 everfrost_expedition.13.t: "Strange Marks"
 everfrost_expedition.13.d: "During the expedition's advances through the snow a strange rock with unknown marks has been discovered, partly buried under their feet."
 everfrost_expedition.13.f: ""A light-colored rock was dug up this very morning. Its smooth texture and perfect curvature was only interrupted by a pattern of unfamiliar marks, all appearing in a sequence that none of our men could dare to decipher. When positioned between one's eye and the sun, its tone varies, seemingly depending on the time of the day; now white, now yellow, at dusk — green.""
 everfrost_expedition.13.f2: ""A light-colored rock was dug up this very morning. Its smooth texture and perfect curvature was only interrupted by a pattern of unfamiliar marks, all appearing in a sequence that was unintelligible at first, but whose meaning I recognized after a while. I didn't know the language, I didn't even know the twisted words in complete isolation, but together — together I knew. They get hungry, you know. Hungry.""
 everfrost_expedition.13.a: "Stop and study it."

  locari.1.t: "Secrets of the Draconic Murals"
  locari.1.d: "After months of careful study, our scholars have finally deciphered the ancient mural found in the labyrinthine dragon ruins. Their findings reveal something extraordinary: the location of the legendary Gem Dragons' tombs, long thought to be lost to time. These magnificent creatures, once revered for their wisdom and power, now lie hidden beneath the earth. We must decide whether to act on this discovery and uncover the ancient resting place."
  locari.1.f: "The mural spoke of shimmering dragons, their scales glittering like precious gems, who were entombed deep within the heart of the land. Their slumber has stretched across centuries, awaiting those brave or foolish enough to disturb the silence of their ancient crypts."
