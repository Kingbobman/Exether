They retain their natural neophobia with their newfound curiosity. Awakened Fauna are incredibly sensitive psionic creatures, and have the natural ability to sense the emotions and intent of other creatures, and to internalize and mirror particularly strong or persistent moods from others. As a consequence, the different Awakened cultures have been profoundly impacted by their first meeting with the other races of Exether. The simians faced fear and hate, and so they fear and hate. The binturong faced cautious curiosity, and therefore are cautiously curious. The bears of the east coast, isolated from the wider world until recent times, have the most opportunity to change.

The fall of their dark empire, the Jundɑugkettho, has forced them into the shadows as their vile, well-honed methods of coercion and violence are used against each other. If the Naga were ever able to restore the Jundɑugkettho Empire, and incorporate the horrible methods of war common to this new age of magic, there’s no telling what horrors they may unleash…."

They were a slave species, used to build mighty ziggurats. But the Namkhaven were not as servile as their masters believed, and in an act of heroic sacrifice, a massive uprising and a mysterious ritual banished the Asuroth from Exether as the dark angels were preparing to sweep over the world. Namkhaven are the unsung saviors of Exether. The Namkhazen are proud, grim, and introspective people. They are natural psionics, with the power imposed on them so that the Asuroth and naga could relish feeling their suffering. Now free, they use their psionics to defend their communities, honing this skill and their martial arts to prepare for the day the Asuroth will return. However, the abrupt arrival of modernity has caught these patient guardians flat-footed. Ancient martial arts and monk orders may do little against a line of field artillery."
